# JavaScript Utilities

I find myself copying little utility functions and "classes" I've written from project to project, so I figured it'd be a cool idea to just have a repository where they all live on their own.

Most of those probably already exist as some npm package, but I like to tailor things to my needs. All these were implemented by me.

I aim to make every single entry here well-documented, so feel free to click around on some files and learn how I've built things, why I've built them that way, and how you can use them in your own projects.
